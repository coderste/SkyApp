# SkyBet App

This project was completed for the Sky Betting & Gaming test.

## Technology Choice

The technology I have chosen to create this app is React.
The server we use in this app is the webpack dev server

## Getting Started

### Installing and Running the App

```bash
# Installing node dependencies with yarn (or npm)
yarn install

# Starting the dev server
yarn dev:start
```

The Dev Server will now be available on `http://localhost:8000/`
